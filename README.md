# MusicTouch
MusicTouch is my first-real app in Swift.

It meets an own need for a music player managed by gestures. Perfect for moments when you are driving and you can not look at the iPhone screen to stop/play music, swipe to the next/previous song, increase/decrease the volume, etc.

There was an old app for that, but it doesn’t work anymore since iOS 10 (I guess). So, I thought that could be a good idea to make my own app while I learn Swift.

It uses another own project (PDMUtils) with some ‘utils’ classes.

Gestures when playing music:
- Tap on the screen to start/stop music
- Swipe from right to left to go to the next song
- Swipe from left to right to go to previous song
- Swipe up or down, with two fingers, to increase or decrease volume
- Swipe up, with one finger, to show the songs queue
- Pinch over the songs queue to hide it

You can navigate through you music library:
- Playlists
- Artists
- Albums
- Songs
